Howdy ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹. Looks like you are running @jsonstack/model but you haven't set a Tensorflow backend. 
To do so, simply import (or require) your tensorflow library, and call setBackend like so,

import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
import * as jsm from '@jsonstack/model';
jsm.setBackend(tf);

That will let @jsonstack/model know you wish to use a tensorflow library to perform your calculations.
